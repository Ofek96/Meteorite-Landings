# Title of Your Final Project

## Project Summary

(Write your 5-10 line summary here. Briefly explain what the project is about, the problem it solves or the question it answers, the main methods or techniques used, and the key findings or outcomes.)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Link to your Public Kaggle Dataset](YOUR_PUBLIC_KAGGLE_DATASET_URL_HERE)

*(If you are also including the CSV directly in the GitHub repository, you can also mention that here, e.g., "The dataset is also available in this repository as `your_dataset_name.csv`.")*

## Most Impressive Graph

(Provide 1-2 sentences describing what the graph shows and why it's significant.)

![Most Impressive Graph](PATH_TO_YOUR_SCREENSHOT_IN_THE_REPO)

*(To make this work, you'll first need to take a screenshot of your graph, save it as an image file (e.g., `graph_screenshot.png`), and upload it to your GitHub repository, perhaps in an `images` folder or directly in the root. Then, replace `PATH_TO_YOUR_SCREENSHOT_IN_THE_REPO` with the correct relative path, e.g., `graph_screenshot.png` or `images/graph_screenshot.png`)*

## DataCamp Testimonial

(Write 2-4 sentences here about how your learning experience at DataCamp helped you complete this project. Be specific if possible, mentioning particular courses, skills, or concepts.)
For example: "The skills I developed in DataCamp's 'Data Scientist with Python' career track, particularly in data manipulation with Pandas and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, were instrumental in cleaning the data and uncovering key insights for this project. The structured approach to learning machine learning concepts also gave me the confidence to apply [mention a specific algorithm or technique] effectively."
