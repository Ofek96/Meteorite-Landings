# Meteorite Analysis Project

## Project Summary

This project explores meteorite data to uncover insights about their landings, classifications, and geographical trends. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, the project seeks to answer questions like: Which regions of the world have experienced the most meteorite landings? How does the geographical distribution of observed falls differ from that of found meteorites? Are there any geographical differences or differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to Earth?
 
Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly, the data was cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to reveal meaningful patterns. Key findings:
* The distribution of meteorite landing is not uniform, and most of them fell in Anterctica.
* The distribution of observed meteorite impact locations roughly matches the population density map of the Earth.
* There is almost no differences over time in the class/category of meteorites that have fallen to Earth.

The project highlights the value of data analysis in understanding natural phenomena and showcases the power of Python for data exploration and visualization.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Meteorite Landings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/meteorite-landings)
The dataset is also available in this repository as `meteorite-landings.csv`.

## Most Impressive Graph

(Provide 1-2 sentences describing what the graph shows and why it's significant.)

![Most Impressive Graph](PATH_TO_YOUR_SCREENSHOT_IN_THE_REPO)

*(To make this work, you'll first need to take a screenshot of your graph, save it as an image file (e.g., `graph_screenshot.png`), and upload it to your GitHub repository, perhaps in an `images` folder or directly in the root. Then, replace `PATH_TO_YOUR_SCREENSHOT_IN_THE_REPO` with the correct relative path, e.g., `graph_screenshot.png` or `images/graph_screenshot.png`)*

## DataCamp Testimonial

(Write 2-4 sentences here about how your learning experience at DataCamp helped you complete this project. Be specific if possible, mentioning particular courses, skills, or concepts.)
For example: "The skills I developed in DataCamp's 'Data Scientist with Python' career track, particularly in data manipulation with Pandas and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, were instrumental in cleaning the data and uncovering key insights for this project. The structured approach to learning machine learning concepts also gave me the confidence to apply [mention a specific algorithm or technique] effectively."
